# Wall of sound

This is a dummy [project](https://mistermv.usampl.com/) that I made in order to play around with React and the Serverless Framework.

It's a sampler, so you can basically play and share audio clips of a [French Streamer](https://twitter.com/mvcaster).

Uers can send me new clip requests by email (`+` icon in the header). It works by calling a *Lambda function* running nodemailer in the background.
